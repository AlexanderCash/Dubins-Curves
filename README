This software finds the shortest paths between configurations for the Dubin's
car, the forward only car-like vehicle with a constrained turning radius. 

A good description of the equations and basic strategies for doing this are
described in LaValle's book "Planning Algorithms" http://planning.cs.uiuc.edu/node821.html

The approach adopted here is based on the algebraic solutions to the equations
published by Shkel and Lumelsky "Classification of the Dubins set", however, rather
than using the symmetry approach described in that work, a less efficient generate
and test approach is used.

Various revisions of this code have been used in:
